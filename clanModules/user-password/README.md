description = "Automatically generates and configures a password for the specified user account."

If setting the option prompt to true, the user will be prompted to type in their
desired password.

!!! Note This module will set `mutableUsers` to `false`, meaning you can not
manage user passwords through `passwd` anymore.

After the system was installed/deployed the following command can be used to
display the user-password:

```bash
clan secrets get {machine_name}-user-password
```

To regenerate the password, delete the password files in the clan directory and
redeploy the machine.
