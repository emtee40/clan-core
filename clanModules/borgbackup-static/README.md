description = "Statically configure borgbackup with sane defaults."
---

This module implements the `borgbackup` backend and implements sane defaults for
backup management through `borgbackup` for members of the clan.

Configure target machines where the backups should be sent to through `targets`.

Configure machines that should be backuped either through `includeMachines`
which will exclusively add the included machines to be backuped, or through
`excludeMachines`, which will add every machine except the excluded machine to
the backup.
