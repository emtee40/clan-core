# Webkit GTK doesn't interop flawless with Solid.js build result

1. Webkit expects script tag to be in `body` only solid.js puts the in the head.
2. script and css files are loaded with type="module" and crossorigin tags
   beeing set. WebKit silently fails to load then.
3. Paths to resiources are not allowed to start with "/" because webkit
   interprets them relative to the system and not the base url.
4. webkit doesn't support native features such as directly handling external
   urls (i.e opening them in the default browser)
5. Other problems to be found?
