# Initializing a New Clan Project

## Clone the Clan Template

To start a new project, execute the following command to clone the Clan Core
template:

```bash
$ nix flake init -t git+https://git.clan.lol/clan/clan-core
```

This action will generate two primary files: `flake.nix` and `.clan-flake`.

```bash
$ ls -la
drwx------ joerg users   5 B  a minute ago   ./
drwxrwxrwt root  root  139 B  12 seconds ago ../
.rw-r--r-- joerg users  77 B  a minute ago   .clan-flake
.rw-r--r-- joerg users 4.8 KB a minute ago   flake.lock
.rw-r--r-- joerg users 242 B  a minute ago   flake.nix
```

### Understanding the .clan-flake Marker File

The `.clan-flake` marker file serves an optional purpose: it helps the
`clan-cli` utility locate the project's root directory. If `.clan-flake` is
missing, `clan-cli` will instead search for other indicators like `.git`, `.hg`,
`.svn`, or `flake.nix` to identify the project root.

# Migrating Existing NixOS Configuration Flake

Absolutely, let's break down the migration step by step, explaining each action
in detail:

#### Before You Begin

1. **Backup Your Current Configuration**: Always start by making a backup of
   your current NixOS configuration to ensure you can revert if needed.

   ```shell
   cp -r /etc/nixos ~/nixos-backup
   ```

2. **Update Flake Inputs**: The patch adds a new input named `clan-core` to your
   `flake.nix`. This input points to a Git repository for Clan Core. Here's the
   addition:

   ```nix
   inputs.clan-core = {
     url = "git+https://git.clan.lol/clan/clan-core";
     inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
   };
   ```

   - `url`: Specifies the Git repository URL for Clan Core.
   - `inputs.nixpkgs.follows`: Tells Nix to use the same `nixpkgs` input as your
     main input (in this case, it follows `nixpkgs`).

3. **Update Outputs**: Then modify the `outputs` section of your `flake.nix` to
   adapt to Clan Core's new provisioning method. The key changes are as follows:

   Add `clan-core` to the output

   ```diff
   -  outputs = { self, nixpkgs,  }:
   +  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, clan-core }:
   ```

   Previous configuration:

   ```nix
   nixosConfigurations.example-desktop = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
       system = "x86_64-linux";
       modules = [
           ./configuration.nix
       ];
       [...]
   };
   ```

   After change:

   ```nix
   nixosConfigurations = clan-core.lib.buildClan {
       directory = ./.;
       specialArgs = {};
       machines = {
           example-desktop = {
               nixpkgs.hostPlatform = "x86_64-linux";
               imports = [
                   ./configuration.nix
               ];
           };
       };
   };
   ```

   - `nixosConfigurations`: Defines NixOS configurations, using Clan Coreâ€™s
     `buildClan` function to manage the machines.
   - Inside `machines`, a new machine configuration is defined (in this case,
     `example-desktop`).
   - Inside `example-desktop` which is the target machine hostname,
     `nixpkgs.hostPlatform` specifies the host platform as `x86_64-linux`.

4. **Rebuild and Switch**: Rebuild your NixOS configuration using the updated
   flake:

   ```shell
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
   ```

   - This command rebuilds and switches to the new configuration. Make sure to
     include the `--flake .` argument to use the current directory as the flake
     source.

5. **Test Configuration**: Before rebooting, verify that your new configuration
   builds without errors or warnings.

6. **Reboot**: If everything is fine, you can reboot your system to apply the
   changes:

   ```shell
   sudo reboot
   ```

7. **Verify**: After the reboot, confirm that your system is running with the
   new configuration, and all services and applications are functioning as
   expected.

By following these steps, you've successfully migrated your NixOS Flake
configuration to include the `clan-core` input and adapted the `outputs` section
to work with Clan Core's new machine provisioning method.
