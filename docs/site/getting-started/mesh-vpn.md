# Mesh VPN

This guide provides detailed instructions for configuring
[ZeroTier VPN](https://zerotier.com) within Clan. Follow the outlined steps to
set up a machine as a VPN controller (`<CONTROLLER>`) and to include a new
machine into the VPN.

## Concept

By default all machines within one clan are connected via a chosen network
technology.

```{.no-copy}
Clan 
    Node A
    <-> (zerotier / mycelium / ...)
    Node B
```

If you select multiple network technologies at the same time. e.g. (zerotier +
yggdrassil) You must choose one of them as primary network and the machines are
always connected via the primary network.

## 1. Set-Up the VPN Controller

The VPN controller is initially essential for providing configuration to new
peers. Once addresses are allocated, the controller's continuous operation is
not essential.

1. **Designate a Machine**: Label a machine as the VPN controller in the clan,
   referred to as `<CONTROLLER>` henceforth in this guide.
2. **Add Configuration**: Input the following configuration to the NixOS
   configuration of the controller machine:
   ```nix
   clan.networking.zerotier.controller = {
     enable = true;
     public = true;
   };
   ```
3. **Update the Controller Machine**: Execute the following:
   ```bash
   clan machines update <CONTROLLER>
   ```
   Your machine is now operational as the VPN controller.

## 2. Add Machines to the VPN

To introduce a new machine to the VPN, adhere to the following steps:

1. **Update Configuration**: On the new machine, incorporate the following to
   its configuration, substituting `<CONTROLLER>` with the controller machine
   name:
   ```nix
   { config, ... }: {
     clan.networking.zerotier.networkId = builtins.readFile (config.clan.core.clanDir + "/machines/<CONTROLLER>/facts/zerotier-network-id");
   }
   ```
1. **Update the New Machine**: Execute:
   ```bash
   $ clan machines update <NEW_MACHINE>
   ```
   Replace `<NEW_MACHINE>` with the designated new machine name.

   !!! Note "For Private Networks" 1. **Retrieve the ZeroTier ID**: On the
   `new_machine`, execute: `bash $ sudo zerotier-cli info` Example Output:
   `{.console, .no-copy} 200 info d2c71971db 1.12.1 OFFLINE` , where
   `d2c71971db` is the ZeroTier ID. 2. **Authorize the New Machine on the
   Controller**: On the controller machine, execute:
   `bash $ sudo zerotier-members allow <ID>` Substitute `<ID>` with the ZeroTier
   ID obtained previously.

1. **Verify Connection**: On the `new_machine`, re-execute:
   ```bash
   $ sudo zerotier-cli info
   ```
   The status should now be "ONLINE":
   ```{.console, .no-copy}
   200 info d2c71971db 1.12.1 ONLINE
   ```

!!! success "Congratulations!" The new machine is now part of the VPN, and the
ZeroTier configuration on NixOS within the Clan project is complete.

## Further

Currently you can only use **Zerotier** as networking technology because this is
the first network stack we aim to support. In the future we plan to add
additional network technologies like tinc, head/tailscale, yggdrassil and
mycelium.

We chose zerotier because in our tests it was a straight forwards solution to
bootstrap. It allows you to selfhost a controller and the controller doesn't
need to be globally reachable. Which made it a good fit for starting the
project.
