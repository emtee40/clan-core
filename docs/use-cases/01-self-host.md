# Self Hosting

## General Description

Self-hosting refers to the practice of hosting and maintaining servers,
networks, storage, services, and other types of infrastructure by oneself rather
than relying on a third-party vendor. This could involve running a server from a
home or business location, or leasing a dedicated server at a data center.

There are several reasons for choosing to self-host. These can include:

1. Cost savings: Over time, self-hosting can be more cost-effective, especially
   for businesses with large scale needs.

1. Control: Self-hosting provides a greater level of control over the
   infrastructure and services. It allows the owner to customize the system to
   their specific needs.

1. Privacy and security: Self-hosting can offer improved privacy and security
   because data remains under the control of the host rather than being stored
   on third-party servers.

1. Independent: Being independent of third-party services can ensure that one's
   websites, applications, or services remain up even if the third-party service
   goes down.
