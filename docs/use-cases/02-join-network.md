# Joining a cLAN network

## General Description

Joining a self-hosted infrastructure involves connecting to a network, server,
or system that is privately owned and managed, instead of being hosted by a
third-party service provider. This could be a business's internal server, a
private cloud setup, or any other private IT infrastructure that is not publicly
accessible or controlled by outside entities.

## Stories

### Story 1: Joining a private network

Alice' son Bob has never heard of cLAN, but receives an invitation URL from
Alice who already set up private cLAN network for her family.

Bob opens the invitation link and lands on the cLAN website. He quickly learns
about what cLAN is and can see that the invitation is for a private network of
his family that hosts a number of services, like a private voice chat and a
photo sharing platform.

Bob decides to join the network and follows the instructions to install the cLAN
tool on his computer.

Feeding the invitation link to the cLAN tool, bob registers his machine with the
network.

All programs required to interact with the network will be installed and
configured automatically and securely.

Optionally, bob can customize the configuration of these programs through a
simplified configuration interface.

### Story 2: Receiving breaking changes

The cLAN family network which Bob is part of received an update.

The existing photo sharing service has been removed and replaced with another
alternative service. The new photo sharing service requires a different client
app to view and upload photos.

Bob accepts the update. Now his environment will be updated. The old client
software will be removed and the new one installed.

Because Bob has customized the previous photo viewing app, he is notified that
this customization is no longer valid, as the software has been removed
(deprecation message).l

Optionally, Bob can now customize the new photo viewing software through his
cLAN configuration app or via a config file.
